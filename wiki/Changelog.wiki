== 1.3.2 ==
  * GWT compile errors during compile & publish are now transfered into Eclipse error markers
  * The style option is no longer set on compile & publish which allows to use the GWT compiler default
  * Generated resources during compile & publish are now marked as derived and read-only resources in the target folder will be asked to become writable
  * Updated to Eclipse 3.3 M6 (we use some internal API... bad, bad, bad, I know ... but it makes life soo easy)
  * Line endigs of generated ".cache.html/xml" and ".nocache.html" files are now automatically converted to the configured line ending style during compile & publish (note, this is a workaround for a problem in the GWT compiler)
