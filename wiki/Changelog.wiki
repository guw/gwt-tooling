== 1.4.0 ==
  * Added support for using gwt-dev-mac.jar on MacOSX as well as using "-!XstartOnFirstThread" when launching the GWT Browser (fixes [http://code.google.com/p/gwt-tooling/issues/detail?id=32 issue 32])
  * Additional VM arguments can now be specified on a per project basis (fixes [http://code.google.com/p/gwt-tooling/issues/detail?id=46 issue 46])
  * When deploying GWT modules in web projects only the module folder is now deployed instead of the whole GWT compiler output directory (fixes [http://code.google.com/p/gwt-tooling/issues/detail?id=44 issue 44])

== 1.3.4 ==
  * Fixed GWT compiler output parsing to generate Eclipse error markers when using GWT 1.4

== 1.3.3 ==
  * GWT compiler output is now shown in the Eclipse console

== 1.3.2 ==
  * GWT compile errors during compile & publish are now transfered into Eclipse error markers
  * The style option is no longer set on compile & publish which allows to use the GWT compiler default
  * Generated resources during compile & publish are now marked as derived and read-only resources in the target folder will be asked to become writable
  * Updated to Eclipse 3.3 M6 (we use some internal API... bad, bad, bad, I know ... but it makes life soo easy)
  * Line endigs of generated ".cache.html/xml" and ".nocache.html" files are now automatically converted to the configured line ending style during compile & publish (note, this is a workaround for a [http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/issues/detail?id=876 GWT compile issue])
